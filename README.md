# 🖼️ Project: Image Generation with Pre-trained Models

**Platform:** Python (Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab)  

**Libraries Used:**  
- PyTorch  
- Diffusers (Hugging Face)  
- Matplotlib  
- PIL (Python Imaging Library)  
- JSON & datetime utilities  

---

## 🎯 Project Objective
Utilize **pre-trained generative models** such as **Stable Diffusion** to create images from natural language prompts.  
Explore the model’s ability to generate creative, high-quality, and contextually relevant images.

---

## 📦 What's Inside
- Install and load the **Stable Diffusion Pipeline** from Hugging Face Diffusers  
- Prepare and customize **text prompts** for generation  
- Generate multiple images from a single prompt  
- Visualize results using **Matplotlib**  
- Save generated images with timestamps for record-keeping  

---

## 🛠 Techniques Used
- **Pre-trained diffusion models** for text-to-image synthesis  
- Hugging Face **Diffusers** API  
- **Prompt engineering** to influence output quality and style  
- Image visualization with **Matplotlib**  
- File management & logging for generated outputs
